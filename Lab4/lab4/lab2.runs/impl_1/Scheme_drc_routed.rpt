CFGBVS-3#1 Warning
CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Property  
The CONFIG_VOLTAGE property is not set for current_design. To indicate what the configuration bank VCCO will be, the CONFIG_VOLTAGE property must be set to 1.5, 1.8, 2.5, 3.3.  Refer to device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net counter/D1/dflip/Q_reg_LDC_i_1__2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin counter/D1/dflip/Q_reg_LDC_i_1__2/O, cell counter/D1/dflip/Q_reg_LDC_i_1__2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net counter/D2/dflip/Q_reg_LDC_i_1__1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin counter/D2/dflip/Q_reg_LDC_i_1__1/O, cell counter/D2/dflip/Q_reg_LDC_i_1__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net counter/D3/dflip/Q_reg_LDC_i_1__0_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin counter/D3/dflip/Q_reg_LDC_i_1__0/O, cell counter/D3/dflip/Q_reg_LDC_i_1__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net counter/D4/dflip/Q_reg_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin counter/D4/dflip/Q_reg_LDC_i_1/O, cell counter/D4/dflip/Q_reg_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
